Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Titanic Dataset
# Objective
To extract insights from the Titanic dataset using statistical summaries and visualizations, identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies.

# Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Kaggle Notebook (for coding and visualization)
Dataset: Titanic Dataset

# Visualizations

Histograms for Age, Fare distribution.
Countplots for gender, passenger class, survival.
Boxplots for fare distribution by class.
Scatterplots for Age vs Fare.
Correlation Heatmap for numeric features.

# Key Findings
Women and children had significantly higher survival rates.
Passenger class strongly influenced survival chances.
Younger passengers in higher classes had better outcomes.
Some features like Cabin had too many missing values and limited usefulness.

# Deliverables
Kaggle Notebook: All code and visualizations.
PDF Report: Summary of insights.
Dataset: Titanic dataset (CSV format).
